# SQL Challenge 1 Executive Summary
## Problem Statement
Danny’s Diner wants to use data they have collected to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they’ve spent, and also which menu items are their favorite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalized experience for his loyal customers.

Danny's Diner plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program. Additionally, he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use complex SQL statements.

Danny has provided you with a sample of his overall customer data due to privacy issues, but he hopes that these examples are enough for you to write fully functioning SQL queries to help him answer his questions!
## Key Findings and Recommendations
Since the analysis was conducted on a small sample of data, no concrete recommendations can be delivered. However, Danny’s Diner can use the views I have created to surface insights about their full data set. These views can be run with one-line SQL statements. If desired, I can prepare a Python application that runs these statements at the click of a button.
